# Orbit for iOS and OSX

Orbit is an [App.net](http://app.net) storage client for your iPhone, iPad and Mac. 

#### What's going on here?

We built Orbit because we wanted to push the limits of what was possible with App.net file storage. It's been a great run, but with [all the changes](http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/) to AdN lately it's time to open Orbit up to the public. We'll keep Orbit free on all platforms and we'll push updates (via Sparkle on OSX and the App Store on iOS) as it makes sense from open source contributions.

We look forward to the next chapter of Orbit!
